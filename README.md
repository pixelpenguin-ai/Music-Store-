# Music Store

The objective of this project is to develop a centralised music store application. This application will store product information for both customers and artists, allowing for the ability to update, delete, and insert records for various entities. The database is intended for the use of managers and record keepers in a music store. Customers will have the option to place their orders via email or over the phone. It is essential for the database administrator to be able to fulfill customer requests, including the ability to order an album and locate the appropriate one.

The core functionalities of this project include the following:

- Adding, deleting, and updating customer information.
- Adding, deleting, and updating information about albums, artists, and songs.
- Inserting new customer orders and modifying existing ones. A customer order consists of both customer information and product information.
